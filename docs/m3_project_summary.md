### Project Summary ðŸ“š

The domain of the application is the management of data related to tournaments that take place in the online rhythm game "osu!". A significant aspect of the game's culture has to do with competition and seeing "who's the best" --- while the [osu! website](http://osu.ppy.sh/) and by extension the game's underlying systems provide an *overall* leaderboard and ranking system (based only on individual performance), no such thing exists specifically for those who compete in *tournaments*. The system aims to provide tools for the tracking, filtering, and ranking of tournament data such as players, matches, beatmaps, and other such auxiliary information.

### osu! Tournaments ðŸ¥‡
[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) is an online rhythm game where players click circles to the beat of songs ([video here for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYNpkDrCWtA)). Like most rhythm games, your score is related to how accurately you play a "beatmap". For all intents and purposes, a "beatmap" or "map" simply represents a song in combination with its circles/notes. All beatmaps are player-created and player-curated. The interesting part of the game is that it provides global player leaderboards --- maps are given "pp" (performance point) values based on their difficulty. As such, improving your global rank necessitates that you set high scores on difficult beatmaps. Leaderboards also exist for each beatmap, which allow users to see "who set the best play on this map?".

There are two things of note here. Firstly, although global leaderboards exist, osu! is fundamentally a *single-player game*. Your rank improves by setting individual scores, in contrast to, say, a game like chess, where it improves by defeating other players. Secondly, osu!'s pp system has *flaws*. While the game's concept seems simple at face-value, there is in reality such a wide variety of ways one can arrange circles on a screen that it gives way to skillsets/specializations; some players may be better at tapping fast ("speed") and some may be better at cursor movement ("aim"), just to name two very basic examples. The result is that it is nearly impossible to accurately weight the difficulty of every beatmap in relation to each other.

This gives rise to the concept of osu! tournaments, where players compete against each other to see how good they are (and sometimes win prizes). This specifically is the domain of our system. Tournament formats vary but are typically similar to a standard sporting event; players are seeded and then face off in rounds (e.g. round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, finals, grand finals, for a 32-player tournament). One important caveat is that for each round, a staff member called a "mappooler" picks a set of valid beatmaps that can be played for that round. During each match, players take turns picking and competing on maps from the mappool until somebody wins (e.g. in a best-of-13 match, one would have to achieve better scores than their opponent on 7 maps). In a typical scenario, maps in a mappool test a wide breadth of skillsets, and as a result the winner of a tourney can in theory be understood to be the most well-rounded player out of the lot.
